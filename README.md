This is a work in progress!

I have used Fredrick Emmanuel's tutorial as the base for this project. The tutorial can be found here: https://strapi.io/blog/how-to-build-a-to-do-app-using-next-js-and-strapi

This project is an itemlist with create, read, update and delete functions. The frontend is in todo-app folder and backend in todo-api folder. This project uses Strapi, Next.js, TypeScript and Apollo. The purpose of this project is to get me familiar with Strapi and how to connect frontend to backend.

Right now this project is almost identical with the tutorial. I have made some changes to the UI and I'm continuing to develop this project forward to better understand how Strapi works. My next step is to fetch the text I'm updating on the input field and change the editing UI to a modal instead of alert. After that I'll create more fields (like a due date) to Strapi and fetch that data into the itemlist.
